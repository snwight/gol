%%      The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional 
%%      orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two 
%%      possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its
%%      eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, 
%%      vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the 
%%      following transitions occur:
%%
%%      Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if 
%%      caused by under-population.
%%      Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the 
%%      next generation.
%%      Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if 
%%      by overcrowding.
%%      Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live 
%%      cell, as if by reproduction.
%%
%%      The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. 
%%      The first generation is created by applying the above rules 
%%      simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur 
%%      simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is 
%%      sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure 
%%      function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied 
%%      repeatedly to create further generations.
%%
%%  ...that said, this implementation actually allows any BX/SX ruleset
